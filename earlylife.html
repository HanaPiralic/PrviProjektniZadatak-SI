   <h1><b><i>Cancer Prevention Treatment</i></b></h1>

   <p>
    On February 16, 2013, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy at age 37 after learning she had 
    an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.
     Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, 
     actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died of ovarian cancer, while her
      grandmother died of ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, 
      died of breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[240] Following the mastectomy, 
      which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under five percent, Jolie had reconstructive
       surgery involving implants and allografts (transplantations from a donor). Two years later, in March 
       2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a 
       preventive salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of an ovary and its fallopian tube), as she had a fifty 
       percent risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone 
       replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.

    After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds 
    published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. 
    She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo 
    preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children. Jolie further wrote:
     "On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice 
     that in no way diminishes my femininity."

    Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA
     mutations and genetic testing.[242] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,
      while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.
       Dubbed "The Angelina Effect" by a Time cover story, Jolie's influence led to a "global and 
       long-lasting" increase in BRCA gene testing:[246] the number of referrals tripled in Australia 
       and doubled in the United Kingdom, parts of Canada, and India,[246][247][248] as well as significantly
        increased in other European countries and the United States. Researchers in Canada and the United 
        Kingdom found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the 
    same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk. In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated
        for wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs, which were
          later greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated 
        BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.

        "I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."
